# Description:  

The aim of this project is to predict the forest fires to decrease the harm that would occur by these fires.
Different machine learning methods including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) have been used to detect the forest fires;
however, in this project We are planning to apply MLP with more than one hidden layer(16,8) with 'relu' activation function and also apply to Levenberg-Marquardt (LM)
algorithm to predict forest fires and compare the result of them. The RMSE(Root Means Square Error) values of the models have been computed to determine the
performance of the forest fires prediction models.

# Team & Roles:

Ali Akgöl(370709069) and Sultan Güvenbaş(170709055). We both worked in every places such as report and source code e.t.c.

# Structure: 

You can reach source code which name is finalProject.py and csv file which name is forestfires.csv. 

# Language, version, and main file:

We used python language on this project. One of us worked python 3.7 version, the other one worked python 3.9 version. The main file is finalProject.py . 

# Additional:

Report.tex file is in the latex folder
Also, We would like you to know in our commiting part sultanguvenbas and U170709055 are the same person. We do not know why some commits taking from sultanguvenbas, some commits taking from U170709055. However they are the same person as you can guest. You can check it though the insights -> network part. The same problem occured akglali and U370709069.
