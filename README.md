Description:  

The aim of this project is to predict the forest fires to decrease the harm that would occur by these fires.
Different machine learning methods including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) have been used to detect the forest fires;
however, in this project We are planning to apply MLP with more than one hidden layer(16,8) with 'relu' activation function and also apply to Levenberg-Marquardt (LM)
algorithm to predict forest fires and compare the result of them. The RMSE(Root Means Square Error) values of the models have been computed to determine the
performance of the forest fires prediction models.

Team & Roles:

Ali Akgöl(370709069) and Sultan Güvenbaş(170709055). We both worked in every places such as report and source code e.t.c.

Structure: 



Language, version, and main file:

We used python language on this project. One of us worked python 3.7 version, the other one worked python 3.9 version. The main file is finalProject.py . 

Additional:

Report.tex file is in the latex folder
